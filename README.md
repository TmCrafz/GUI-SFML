# GUI-SFML
A small GUI System for SFML. Just for learning purpose and gather experience.

## Libraries
To use GUI-SFML you need the header only library "JSON for Modern C++".
Just download the file json.hpp of the stable Version 2.1.1 from https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases and copy the file into the "libs" folder.
